## 📱 What is Lyft-Up?

Lyft-Up is an iOS app that combines **clean workout tracking** with **social features** to help you and your friends stay consistent and motivated in the gym. This is my **first iOS app** that I built using **SwiftUI**. It's a personal project meant to solve a real user need I've experienced: making workouts more interactive, social, and accountable!

Inspired by apps like **RepCount**, Lyft-Up lets you:  
- Build your own routines  
- Log sets/reps/weights  
- Automatically reference your last performance to push yourself further  

…but with a twist:  
> 👥 Follow friends, view their workout history, and share your own progress!

<summary><b>💡 Why I'm Building This</b></summary>

Most gym apps either feel too **bloated** or too **isolated**. They don't help you stay consistent, and they don't let you connect with the people you train with. Lyft-Up was born from the idea that:  
- Progress is more fun when shared  
- Accountability boosts consistency  
- Gym apps should be fast, clear, and motivating
