# Lyft-Up 🚀
**Track your lifts. Follow your friends. Stay accountable.**

## 📱 What is Lyft-Up?

Lyft-Up is an iOS app that combines clean workout tracking with social features to help you and your friends stay consistent and motivated in the gym.

Inspired by apps like **RepCount**, Lyft-Up lets you build your own routines, log sets/reps/weights, and automatically reference your last performance to push yourself further, but with a twist:  
👥 You can follow friends, see their workout history, and share your own progress!

This is my **first iOS app** built from scratch using SwiftUI. It's a personal project meant to solve a real user need I've experienced: making workouts more interactive, social, and accountable, without the bloat or distractions of other fitness apps.

## 💡 Why I'm Building This

Most gym apps either feel too bloated or too isolated. They don't help you stay consistent, and they don't let you connect with the people you train with. Lyft-Up was born from the idea that:

- Progress is more fun when shared  
- Accountability boosts consistency  
- Gym apps should be fast, clear, and motivating
