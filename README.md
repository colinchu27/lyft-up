**Track your lifts. Follow your friends. Stay accountable.**

## ðŸ“± What is Lyft-Up?

Lyft-Up is an iOS app that combines clean workout tracking with social features to help you and your friends stay consistent and motivated in the gym.

Inspired by apps like **RepCount**, Lyft-Up lets you build your own routines, log sets/reps/weights, and automatically reference your last performance to push yourself further â€” but with a twist:  
ðŸ‘¥ You can follow friends, see their workout history, and share your own progress.

This is my **first iOS app** built from scratch using SwiftUI. It's a personal project meant to solve a real user need Iâ€™ve experienced: making workouts more interactive, social, and accountable â€” without the bloat or distractions of other fitness apps.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Iâ€™m Building This

Most gym apps either feel too bloated or too isolated. They donâ€™t help you stay consistent, and they donâ€™t let you connect with the people you train with. Lyft-Up was born from the idea that:

- Progress is more fun when shared  
- Accountability boosts consistency  
- Gym apps should be fast, clear, and motivating
